# <i class="fas join"></i>Join the Lab

The Stajich lab mentors Postdoctoral fellows, Graduate and Undergraduate students with computational and experimental biology interests.  A predominant theme is the intersection of genomic tools to study evolution and interactions of fungi with their environment, other microbes, and plants or animals.
