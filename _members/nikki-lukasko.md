I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Microbiology & Plant Pathology at the UC Riverside advised by Dr. Alex Putnam and Dr. Jason Stajich. I recieved my Ph.D. in Plant Pathology at Michigan State. I work on projects related to the genomics, population genetics and disease pathobiology of Fusarium wilt in Lettuce.
