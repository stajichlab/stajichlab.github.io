         We enjoyed a wonderful spring flower season here in Southern California (Harford Springs Riverside County Regional Park)

Several publications were accepted and published in last few months and want to highlight the hard work from lab members and collaborators.

Jinfeng lead article published on the localized burst of Rice Transposable Elements Ping and Pong in only a subset of the domesticated lineages and clues to what changed to drive their increased activity.

 Variation of mPing, Ping, and Pong_ element copy number in rice subgroups https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08451-3/figures/2

A fun collaboration lead by Adam Bewick and Bob Schmitz we called #MycoMeth explored diversity of Cytosine DNA Methylation in Fungi looking at the 5-methylcytosine (5mC) marks and evolution of the fungal 5mC methyltransferases.


Genomewide 5mC profiles https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0810-9/figures/2

Two Zygolife project papers. One on genome evolution and phylogenic position of Endogone - a truffle forming Mucoromycotina fungus.This was quite challenging but interesting project to tackle, lead by Ying Chang in the Spatafora Lab. Dr Chang took a metagenomics approach to capture these unculturable fungi followed by bioinformatic analyses to isolate the fungal and Mucoromycotina component of the dataset.

&lt;figcaption&gt;Phylogenetic placement and divergence time estimation of Endogonales and the evolution of fungal plant‐cell‐wall‐degrading enzymes (PCWDEs)

A second paper lead by William Davis from Tim James lab on the genomes and phylogeny of Zoopagomycotina fungi which include nematophagous and mycoparasites.

Jason participated in a Marine Fungi workshop on the unexplored diversity in the marine environments and co-authored this perspective on the opportunities and challenges in characterizing and studying these fungi.

 Morphological diversity of fungi collected from a biotic host. Fungal collection isolated from a marine sponge,Ircinia variabilis (formerly Psammocinia sp.).

Former postdoc Ousmane Cissé developed FGMP, a tool for assessing completeness of fungal genomes which uses both conserved protein coding markers that can include multicopy gene families and conserved non-coding DNA regions.  This was published this month as well, congrats Ousmane!

        There have been several manuscripts are now out from work that was done over the last few years. It has been great to be able to collaborate with many research teams as part of this work.Been slow to mention these but wanted to make sure and call out the hard work from everyone. A long term collaboration lead by Cene Gostinčar on population genomics in Hortaea, an ascomycete black yeast, complemented some reference genome work we published last year [1]. 

Former postdoc Ousmane Cissé published his work on Pneumocystis at the NIH in his current postdoc[2].

  
    
  
  
    
      Figure 6 - Overview of the timing and evolution of Pneumocystis and their mammalian hosts

    
  


Current postdoc Yan Wang published part of his thesis work and we worked on these data a bit as part of the zygolife project here [3]. 

Graduate students Nat Pombubpa collaborated with Plant Sciences and Jeff Diez lab graduate student Courtney Collins on her thesis work looking at the mycobiome differences of soils in an alpine gradient with and without invasive shrub introduction [4]. 

Andrii Gryganskyi’s work on Rhizopus phylogeny with some of the first multi-genome work on this genus that was one of the earliest collaborations on some ZyGoLife questions [5].

  
    
  
  


 Work exploring whether Transposable elements have a role in stage-specific gene expression in Coccidioides with Theo Kirkland and Anna Muszewska [6]. 

A collaboration lead by Tom Richard’s lab and Guy Leonard sequence and assembled and annotated a genome of a ‘pseudofungus’ hyphochytriomycete called Hyphochytrium catenoides [7].

I think I forgot to also call out that last year postdoc Jinfeng Chen published work collaboratively with postdocs Lu Lu and Sofia Robb on the active Rice transposable element system mPing and Ping [8].

Good work all!

I also learned a lot through this project and was excited to be able to merge evolutionary and computational approaches. The project lead to the surprising findings of a gene important for light sensing that is shared among just the zoosporic fungi with a flagellate life stage and animals.This project has been going for a while Edgar and I discovered this protein in 2008 when we started independently analyzing the em Batrachochytrium em genome, the first chytrid fungus sequenced. Based on sequence similarity we realized it looked like an animal rhodopsin, a 7 transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor GPCR . These rhodopsins are called type II opsins and typically respond to green light. We went looking for this in the first place because of a href https: www.nature.com nature journal v387 n6632 full 387465a0.html work a published in 1997 from Ken Foster s lab which showed that zoosporic chytrid fungi respond to green light and that likely this behavior is due to a rhodopsin or rhodopsin-like GPCR We found longer intact copy in the genome of the chytrid em S. punctatus, so decided to focus on that copy - though we later discovered additional modifications of the predicted gene structure a href https: github.com stajichlab chytropsin tree master sequences SPPG 00350 updated appeared necessary. a We decided to do some homology modeling with the solved structure of a squid rhodopsin as shown in a href https: doi.org 10.7717 peerj.3206 fig-1 Figure 1. a This confirmed that the sequence was compatible with the Type II Opsin structure. The paper documents several other computational simulations to test for the likely binding chromophore and hypothesis testing about the stability of the protein structure. Overall this work provides confidence that the sequence encoded in the genome of the zoosporic fungus can fold into a structure compatible with an opsin. caption id attachment 1661 align aligncenter width 162 img src images wp upload 2017 04 fig-1A-162x300.png alt fig-1A Figure 1A: Structural alignment of S. punctatus em homology model grey with em T. pacificus em crystal structure light purple caption It still remains to be tested if this opsin-like gene can biochemically function in this way. We hope to explore more of that with some additional work in the future. We have also nearly completed our manuscript analyzing the evolutionary history of this protein in fungi and related species to give a better picture of the timing of the emergence of this receptor-like protein. This project has helped advance some ideas about how zoosporic fungi interact with their environment based on genomic and computational analyses. This gene is a good candidate for future investigations into environmental sensing and signaling in zoosporic fungi. p">

The meeting was fantastic from the Clark Kerr campus at UC Berkeley we had dorm life living so everyone was close by and could eat meals together. The talks and posters were really outstanding and such fun to talk about interesting research in fungi. Clearly genomics, next generation sequencing are at the forefront of tools used by the community but new approaches to visualizing communities and exploring the interactions between fungi and partners like bacteria and plants were very well explored in the meeting. Some great work on microbiomes and mycobiomes of insects and amphibians also made for some fascinating new results. p p There was a MSA session dedicated to some results from the a href http: zygolife.org home ZyGoLife a project and our team also had a one day meeting earlier in the week at the Joint Genome Institute to catch up on all the different team projects a long post on this will appear on the zygolife project page soon . It was also fun to catch up with former lab member Steven Ahrendt who now works at JGI on early diverging fungi genome projects.The meeting also featured Arturo Casadevall as the Karling lecture - an honor to bring in a scientist who is likely an outside member of the MSA community to speak about fungi. Dr Casadevall gave a lecture that covered the importance of collaboration, the impact of the pressure to publish in one word journals , and reviewed his provocative hypothesis about the link in the success of fungi, dinofall of dinosaurs, and rise of mammals. He also paid tribute to Thomas Taylor, a Zygolife collaborator who sadly passed away this Spring but who would have been the Karling lecturer this year. p p a data-flickr-embed true href https: www.flickr.com photos stajichlab 28904939802 in dateposted title IMG 1184 img src https: live.staticflickr.com 8742 28904939802 c53f809722 b.jpg width 768 height 1024 alt IMG 1184 a script async src embedr.flickr.com assets client-code.js charset utf-8 script p ul li Jason spoke on new population genomics work on Candida and Fusarium, while Sawyer presented a poster on em Rhizopus stolonifer em resequencing and population genomics. li li Derreck presented a poster on Bacteria-Fungi interactions on em Serratia em and zygomycete fungi li li Nat presented his poster on data from first environmental sequencing of desert biological soil crusts from Joshua Tree National Park. li ul p On the way back we stopped for an overnight in Pinnacles National Park.

      <p data-search="p I had the great opportunity to attend the a href http: www.imc10.com 2014 home.html International Mycological Congress 10 a in Bangkok, Thailand during this summer. It was filled with talks from mycologists studying cell biology, genetics, evolution, symbioses, ecology, production of secondary metabolites, and many other aspects of mycology from across the world. It was a great chance to hear about new work in many different experimental systems. I chaired a session on Population Genomics and GWAS in Fungi and got to hear some great perspectives and approaches on model and non-model systems. I presented my talk on data analysis tools in metagenomics. I got to catch up with many friends collaborators colleagues and meet some new folks.I m jealous of the folks who got to take some of the post-conference excursions through Thailand or ventured even further to Laos and Cambodia. Hopefully next trip to this area I ll have the chance to explore more. img src images wp upload 2014 08 2014-08-06-17.54.21-768x1024.jpg alt 2014-08-06 17.54.21 img src images wp upload 2014 08 2014-08-05-06.50.26-1024x368.jpg alt 2014-08-05 06.50.26 img src images wp upload 2014 08 2014-08-03-14.08.02.jpg alt 2014-08-03 14.08.02 img src images wp upload 2014 08 2014-08-06-18.00.21-2-767x1024.jpg alt 2014-08-06 18.00.21-2 img src images wp upload 2014 08 2014-08-06-18.41.31-1024x1024.jpg alt 2014-08-06 18.41.31 p">

It was a real pleasure to have him here for the few months and look forward to a chance to keep interacting on many of our projects.  Way to go Edgar!

        Well the 1st quarter is over and had a few observations about life of an assistant professor.1. Remember to check that you don’t need to turn in grades! I thought I could safely ignore emails about sending in grades, since I wasn’t teaching this quarter, but meant I forgot to turn in grades for grad students working in the lab. Whoops! Lesson learned.

        There have been several manuscripts are now out from work that was done over the last few years. It has been great to be able to collaborate with many research teams as part of this work.Been slow to mention these but wanted to make sure and call out the hard work from everyone. A long term collaboration lead by Cene Gostinčar on population genomics in Hortaea, an ascomycete black yeast, complemented some reference genome work we published last year [1]. 

Former postdoc Ousmane Cissé published his work on Pneumocystis at the NIH in his current postdoc[2].

  
    
  
  
    
      Figure 6 - Overview of the timing and evolution of Pneumocystis and their mammalian hosts

    
  


Current postdoc Yan Wang published part of his thesis work and we worked on these data a bit as part of the zygolife project here [3]. 

Graduate students Nat Pombubpa collaborated with Plant Sciences and Jeff Diez lab graduate student Courtney Collins on her thesis work looking at the mycobiome differences of soils in an alpine gradient with and without invasive shrub introduction [4]. 

Andrii Gryganskyi’s work on Rhizopus phylogeny with some of the first multi-genome work on this genus that was one of the earliest collaborations on some ZyGoLife questions [5].

  
    
  
  


 Work exploring whether Transposable elements have a role in stage-specific gene expression in Coccidioides with Theo Kirkland and Anna Muszewska [6]. 

A collaboration lead by Tom Richard’s lab and Guy Leonard sequence and assembled and annotated a genome of a ‘pseudofungus’ hyphochytriomycete called Hyphochytrium catenoides [7].

I think I forgot to also call out that last year postdoc Jinfeng Chen published work collaboratively with postdocs Lu Lu and Sofia Robb on the active Rice transposable element system mPing and Ping [8].

Good work all!

I also learned a lot through this project and was excited to be able to merge evolutionary and computational approaches. The project lead to the surprising findings of a gene important for light sensing that is shared among just the zoosporic fungi with a flagellate life stage and animals.This project has been going for a while Edgar and I discovered this protein in 2008 when we started independently analyzing the em Batrachochytrium em genome, the first chytrid fungus sequenced. Based on sequence similarity we realized it looked like an animal rhodopsin, a 7 transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor GPCR . These rhodopsins are called type II opsins and typically respond to green light. We went looking for this in the first place because of a href https: www.nature.com nature journal v387 n6632 full 387465a0.html work a published in 1997 from Ken Foster s lab which showed that zoosporic chytrid fungi respond to green light and that likely this behavior is due to a rhodopsin or rhodopsin-like GPCR We found longer intact copy in the genome of the chytrid em S. punctatus, so decided to focus on that copy - though we later discovered additional modifications of the predicted gene structure a href https: github.com stajichlab chytropsin tree master sequences SPPG 00350 updated appeared necessary. a We decided to do some homology modeling with the solved structure of a squid rhodopsin as shown in a href https: doi.org 10.7717 peerj.3206 fig-1 Figure 1. a This confirmed that the sequence was compatible with the Type II Opsin structure. The paper documents several other computational simulations to test for the likely binding chromophore and hypothesis testing about the stability of the protein structure. Overall this work provides confidence that the sequence encoded in the genome of the zoosporic fungus can fold into a structure compatible with an opsin. caption id attachment 1661 align aligncenter width 162 img src images wp upload 2017 04 fig-1A-162x300.png alt fig-1A Figure 1A: Structural alignment of S. punctatus em homology model grey with em T. pacificus em crystal structure light purple caption It still remains to be tested if this opsin-like gene can biochemically function in this way. We hope to explore more of that with some additional work in the future. We have also nearly completed our manuscript analyzing the evolutionary history of this protein in fungi and related species to give a better picture of the timing of the emergence of this receptor-like protein. This project has helped advance some ideas about how zoosporic fungi interact with their environment based on genomic and computational analyses. This gene is a good candidate for future investigations into environmental sensing and signaling in zoosporic fungi. p">

The meeting was fantastic from the Clark Kerr campus at UC Berkeley we had dorm life living so everyone was close by and could eat meals together. The talks and posters were really outstanding and such fun to talk about interesting research in fungi. Clearly genomics, next generation sequencing are at the forefront of tools used by the community but new approaches to visualizing communities and exploring the interactions between fungi and partners like bacteria and plants were very well explored in the meeting. Some great work on microbiomes and mycobiomes of insects and amphibians also made for some fascinating new results. p p There was a MSA session dedicated to some results from the a href http: zygolife.org home ZyGoLife a project and our team also had a one day meeting earlier in the week at the Joint Genome Institute to catch up on all the different team projects a long post on this will appear on the zygolife project page soon . It was also fun to catch up with former lab member Steven Ahrendt who now works at JGI on early diverging fungi genome projects.The meeting also featured Arturo Casadevall as the Karling lecture - an honor to bring in a scientist who is likely an outside member of the MSA community to speak about fungi. Dr Casadevall gave a lecture that covered the importance of collaboration, the impact of the pressure to publish in one word journals , and reviewed his provocative hypothesis about the link in the success of fungi, dinofall of dinosaurs, and rise of mammals. He also paid tribute to Thomas Taylor, a Zygolife collaborator who sadly passed away this Spring but who would have been the Karling lecturer this year. p p a data-flickr-embed true href https: www.flickr.com photos stajichlab 28904939802 in dateposted title IMG 1184 img src https: live.staticflickr.com 8742 28904939802 c53f809722 b.jpg width 768 height 1024 alt IMG 1184 a script async src embedr.flickr.com assets client-code.js charset utf-8 script p ul li Jason spoke on new population genomics work on Candida and Fusarium, while Sawyer presented a poster on em Rhizopus stolonifer em resequencing and population genomics. li li Derreck presented a poster on Bacteria-Fungi interactions on em Serratia em and zygomycete fungi li li Nat presented his poster on data from first environmental sequencing of desert biological soil crusts from Joshua Tree National Park. li ul p On the way back we stopped for an overnight in Pinnacles National Park.

It was filled with talks from mycologists studying cell biology, genetics, evolution, symbioses, ecology, production of secondary metabolites, and many other aspects of mycology from across the world. It was a great chance to hear about new work in many different experimental systems. I chaired a session on Population Genomics and GWAS in Fungi and got to hear some great perspectives and approaches on model and non-model systems. I presented my talk on data analysis tools in metagenomics. I got to catch up with many friends collaborators colleagues and meet some new folks.I m jealous of the folks who got to take some of the post-conference excursions through Thailand or ventured even further to Laos and Cambodia.

Since we gathered at a local mexican restaurant with whimsical and amazing sculptures and art from recycled material, it was fitting  we document it with pictures.

As the gets better at this I ll probably be able to give better feedback about dead-ends and keeping people on track earlier in the game. We are still getting our timing together to have regular lab meetings and journal clubs that I expect to be the heart of the learning that happens in the lab at this point. I m teaching programming, bioinformatics, phylogenetics amp; molecular evolution, and mycology at the outset and so am working to make these subjects more approachable with the right kind of background reading materials. Probably will have to turn this into a review or primer someday as I feel like this synthesis of different fields is not something I can point anyone to just one or two resources for.I m still getting aquatinted with who to ask for help and where to go for advice, but I ve been lucky to have generous junior and senior colleagues who have provided encouragement and advice. Here s to hoping next quarter I learn a little more about how to do things, focus on the grant writing, and make some tangible progress on the research projects that need some new data before this summer. A lot of papers are queued up from collaborative work that were submitted this month and I hope that means more focus on the two main project foci of the lab. New folks will be joining us next quarter and I m excited about the progress we have made and will be able to make as everyone comes up to speed.Happy New Year li ol">
        Well the 1st quarter is over and had a few observations about life of an assistant professor.1. Remember to check that you don’t need to turn in grades! I thought I could safely ignore emails about sending in grades, since I wasn’t teaching this quarter, but meant I forgot to turn in grades for grad students working in the lab. Whoops! Lesson learned.

  Spending money isn’t that hard, but researching how to spend it on equipment is time consuming.  The optimization of trying to find the best deal, planning for current and future experiments, and establishing new technologies took more time than I expected.  Planning how to best spend money longer term is also taking some time, I don’t know if there is any good formula to rely on because it depends on what future grant support is awarded. But I think that I am getting better at making the equipment decisions - but I am my own sysadmin for macs in the lab and also the new separate (from the shared bioinformatics cluster) linux machines I have for our web and specialized compute needs and find that very time consuming.
  Travel is good, but takes up time that can be spent writing, instructing, and my own research. While I can do much of my research from my laptop and an internet connect, I am distracted when away from lab and doing a disservice to the meeting I am attending if I am always working while on the road.  Better to divide my time better and focus on the meeting at hand. Course this means I should always have the talks finished before I get to the meeting and that has been difficult to guarantee.
  People are important. I can’t do all the research myself. Getting students and postdocs into the lab who can be trained on techniques and the background of the research questions is the most important thing to get the lab moving forward.  I am excited about the teaching and learning process but it is a process that needs a vision and schedule that I establish.  I’m still fine tuning that schedule and the approaches while keeping us aimed toward a vision of the kind of research we will do in the next 3-5 years.

Stopping and reflecting on what was accomplished is good to remind me and remind trainees that we have done things even if it feels like there is a mountain of work ahead.  As the gets better at this I’ll probably be able to give better feedback about dead-ends and keeping people on track earlier in the game.  We are still getting our timing together to have regular lab meetings and journal clubs that I expect to be the heart of the learning that happens in the lab at this point. I’m teaching programming, bioinformatics, phylogenetics &amp; molecular evolution, and mycology at the outset and so am working to make these subjects more approachable with the right kind of background reading materials.  Probably will have to turn this into a review or primer someday as I feel like this synthesis of different fields is not something I can point anyone to just one or two resources for.
I’m still getting aquatinted with who to ask for help and where to go for advice, but I’ve been lucky to have generous junior and senior colleagues who have provided encouragement and advice.  Here’s to hoping next quarter I learn a little more about how to do things, focus on the grant writing, and make some tangible progress on the research projects that need some new data before this summer. A lot of papers are queued up from collaborative work that were submitted this month and I hope that means more focus on the two main project foci of the lab.  New folks will be joining us next quarter and I’m excited about the progress we have made and will be able to make as everyone comes up to speed.Happy New Year!
